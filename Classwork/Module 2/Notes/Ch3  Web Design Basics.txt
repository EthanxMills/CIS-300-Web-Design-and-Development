Cascading Style Sheets --> Alternate way of formatting and designing web pages
    - works in tandem with HTML 


Design for your Target Audience:

    - Every page ever has a target audience and should be dev'd as such
        > fun outdoors for couples is colorful with pictures etc.
        > informational resources/instructional text heavy with lots of links elsewhere

Browser Compatibility:

    - Web pages don't all render the same way
        > Good to test pages in the common browsers like Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari
            > Same can apply to screen resolutions for weird proportions, don't want things being cut away like on mobile
            > Generally center your content and have sections utilize percentages when setting widths

Types of Organization:

    - Sites can be setup to be navigated, 3 common ways
        1. Hierarchical (nested pages like products tab --> different product specific pages)
            > too shallow a page is a waste, too many choices = too confusing 
            > Same for too deep, use the 3-click rule for how deep to go (can get anywhere on the site from anywhere in 3 clicks max)
        
        2. Linear (series of pages, something like a tour, presentation, or tutorial)
            > meant for Sequential Viewing
        
        3. Random or Web (not common commercially)
            > general collection of pages
            > more common artistic/conceptual Sites

Key Design principles
    1. Repetition (repeat visual elements and strong themes)
    2. Contrast (use to create excitement and draw attention, too flat = lost)
    3. Proximity (Group related items)
    4. Alignment (align elements to create a visual unity)

DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE ACCESSIBILITY PARTS WE LEARNED 
    - physical disability
    - old computer
    - slow connection
    - mobile phone

    POUR:
        - Perceivable (easy to see or hear)
        - Operable (all can be navigated with both keyboard and mouse)
        - Understandable (intuitive, easy to read, well organized)
        - Robust (content is correctly written to work with common OS, Browsers, and Assistive Tech)

Writing Web:
    - Avoid blocks of text, no one cares
    -  Bullets are Good
    - heading and subheading expedite the process
    - short paragraph if needed to elaborate

Making it "easy" to read:
    - common fonts (Arial, Helvetica, Verdant, Times New Roman)
    - medium text sizes
    - contrast with text and background
    - shorter lines in columns instead of wide areas of horizontal text
    - avoid click here for hyperlinks, check your spelling

Design:
    - color is RGB so use hex code for color values (3 pairs of two values for each set of RGB tones)
        > #FF0000 is red, middle two is green, back two is blue, adjust as needed
    - See web color pallette for common shared ones http://webdevbasics.net/color 
    - usually choose off either
        1. monochromatic for themes
        2. choose color of logo or photo for page
        3. pick your favorite and go

Load Time:
    - pumps up fast, aim to keep your pages under 60K on home (including media)

Navigation Suggestions:
    - Make sure it's easy and consider using
        > Nav bars
        > breadcrumbs
        > graphics =  navigate
        > Site Map
        > Site Search Feature

Wireframe:
    - Sketch or Blueprint of a website
    - basic shit like "logo goes here" and outline areas

    - Most important info above the fold of a page
    - white space is healthy
    - page layout can make or break
