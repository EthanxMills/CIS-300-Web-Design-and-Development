    Advantages of CSS
        > Greater typography and page layout control
        > Style is separate from structure
        > Styles can be stored in a separate document and linked to from the web page
        > Potentially smaller documents
        > Easier site maintenance
    
    4 Types of Cascading Style Sheets
        > Inline Styles
             Configured in the body of the web page
             Use the style attribute of an HTML tag
             Apply only to the specific element
        > Embedded Styles
             Configured in the head section of a web page.
             Use the HTML <style> element
             Apply to the entire web page document
        > External Styles
             Configured in a separate text file with .css file extension
             The HTML <link> element in the head section of a web page associates it with the .css file
        > Imported Styles
             Similar to External Styles
             We’ll concentrate on the other three types of styles
    
    The "Cascade"
        - Flows in an order of layering
            > Browser Default --> External styles --> Inline styles --> HTML attributes
    
    Syntax
        - Each is composed of rules that describe the styling to be applied
        - each rule contains a SELECTOR and a DECLARATION
            ex: 
                SELECTOR(DEC PROPERTY: DEC VALUE)
                body {  color: #0000FF;
                        background-color: #FFFF00; } 
            
            **can also use rgb(x,y,z) or presets like 'blue' or 'yellow'
    
    Inline CSS with the Style Attribute 
        - Configured in the body of the Web Page 
        - Use the style attribute tag of HTML
            > uses value attribute pairs
            ex. 
                <h1 style="color:#ff0000">Heading text is red</h1>
                <h1 style="color:#FF0000;background-color:#cccccc">This is displayed as a red heading with gray background</h1>

    Configure Embedded CSS with the Style Element 
        - conduct in larger blocks in sections for enter web page doc, these will override whatever is there 
        ex. <style>
                body { background-color: #000000;
                color: #FFFFFF;
                }
            </style>
        
        - CSS style rules are contained in a text file separate from the HTML documents; but multiple web pages can associate with the same external sheet 
            > The External Style Sheet text file:
                extension ".css"
                contains only style rules
                does not contain any HTML tags
    
    The <link> Element
        - self contained tag
        - placed in the header to associate the style sheet file with the web page
        ex.     
            <link rel="StyleSheet" href="colors.css">
