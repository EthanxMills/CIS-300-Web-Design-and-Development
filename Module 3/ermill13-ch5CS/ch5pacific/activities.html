            <h2>Activities at Pacific Trails</h2>

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>
                    Pacific Trails Resort has 5 miles of hiking trails and is adjacent to a state park. Go it alone or join one of our guided hikes.
                </p>

            <h3>Kayaking</h3>
                <p>
                    Ocean kayaks are available for guest use.
                </p>

            <h3>Bird Watching</h3>
                <p>
                    While anytime is a good time for bird watching at Pacific Trails, we offer guided birdwatching trips at sunrise several times a week.
