                <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                        the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
                        walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
                        opened.</dd>

                <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                        quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                        experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                        cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                        located in the lodge.</dd>

                <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan
                        to dress for changing weather with light layers of
                        clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
                        sense of adventure!</dd>
