                        <p>
                            During my freshman yea from Fall 2018 to Spring 2019, I was part of a team of four students at Arizona State University participating
                            in an Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) programming competition. This competition was non-traditional as all participating teams were
                            chosen AFTER a board of judges reviewed applicant project proposals sent in by teams of varying size wishing to participate.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Skills acquired and utilized throughout the project included C# as our primary language, Unity as the engine for creating our 
                            map & data visualization, front end design principles, back-end design, data storage (a MySQL Database with php), and numerous
                            APIs that we had to integrate into our project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The project spanned from September until the following May with us following the Agile SCRUM Software Development Lifecycle. The team
                            proposal for an application which utilizes crime data to provide user's with a navigational app that directs accounting for crime
                            statistics was accepted. The application would eventually include crime data from the entirety of the United States & would created
                            routes for users getting them to their destination while avoiding certain "danger zones". After the project was completed, the team 
                            attended a final demonstration day where many industry partners of ASU were invited; including important tech figures such as 
                            engineers/leads from Boeing, and officers with the Department of Defense.
