                        <p>
                            Desiring to try my hand at a new area of software engineering; I enrolled for SER 456, a course in embedded systems
                            during the Fall 2021 semester. Initial syntax for the language was rather easy, as I had worked with C previously writing
                            Unix based LKM (loadable kernel modules). Early in the class we explored what exactly makes a micro-controller a micro-controller,
                            and especially how they differ from a CPU you may see in a computer. This base introduction cover our first-steps such as how much
                            memory to expect & generic examples of their capabilities eventually leading to use setting up an ATmega168 micro-controller: as 
                            well as the AVR toolchain for use to flash firmware from laptops to said ATmega168 micro-controller. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each week presented a new module utilizing new tools/features within our micro-controller; beginning with the use of core
                            functions such as Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), Digital to Analog Converter (DAC), and PWM. This gradually increased in
                            complexity so that we would be able to created an embedded systems project of our own with minimal knowledge restrictions when
                            designing the project (such as not being able to use x because we do not know y).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While at the time of writing this, the project is still very much in development & as such I do not have an image to represent my
                            semester project on this page. As substitute, an example project using a potentiometer to control an array of LEDs is shown right.
                            However, my current project plan is a mechanical cupholder where series of buttons will adjust the diameter of a hose clamp that sits
                            around the beverage via a DC motor.
