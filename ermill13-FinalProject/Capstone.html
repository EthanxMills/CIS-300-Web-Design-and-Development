                        <p>
                            As I am in my final year for my degree in Software Engineering, I am working with a team of four peers to complete the signature
                            project based class: Capstone. I won't be able to provide a full description of the project, as I am under NMDA, but I will give a 
                            brief overview of the project and the learning outcomes derived from the prospectus we received at the start of the semester.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the title of the project indicates, our team is attempting to implement a means of creating a solution for error-diffusion which
                            operates in parallel across a dynamically acquired number of processing cores. As it stands, our sponsor is capable of this with a juvenile
                            solution that operates on up to 8-cores with a different method for creating the image segments. As such, our goal is to implement their
                            theoretical solution (which is expected to yield results degrees higher in efficiency than the juvenile solution) in a way that is infinitely
                            scalable for the number of cores available. This undefine upper bound is meant to the greatest extent possible, even considering adaption of
                            the solution to work off of CUDA cores in the future (a core system similar to CPU's in structure but with core count in the thousands).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, this is the extent of the information I am permitted to share. However, the sponsor has expressed that our solution will
                            be released as an open source library post completion of the project. Depending on when you are reading this, it may be linked/attributed
