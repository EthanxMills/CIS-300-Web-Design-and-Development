                        Here I will type out a bio for myself, I have yet to sit down and actually write it though. It will likely
                        have a quicker version of highschool/childhood inspirations and what I do now, such as my service work. Ending
                        it with a nice optimistic look towards future

                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            While now in Arizona, I lived nearly all my life in the town of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yzzkTFhZ3PMdF4Ef6" style="text-decoration: 
                            none;color: #2074f3;">Joliet, Illinois</a>, a town of a hundred fifty thousand residents approximately 30-45 miles from the city of 
                            Chicago. It's hard being so far from everything, but it always gives some peace of mind not having to worry about digging my car out of a 
                            snow bank after some nasty weather.Much as I am now, I grew up captured by the acquisition of knowledge, constantly reading and learning as 
                            much as I could. However, I also maintain my my love for video games which has caused some slight deviation from that in the past; but I 
                            wouldn't trade it for anything. Academic success lead me through high school with ease eventually leading me to here, at Arizona State 
                            University's Polytechnic campus. I also valued a type of triangular balance in my life; with studies, video games, and roughly a decade of 
                            wrestling kept me wellrounded and happy. I've been with my lovely girlfriend for the past seven years and she's always my biggest supporter.

                            <h3>College Education</h3>
                            I am in my fourth year at Arizona State University (As of Fall 2021) anticipating my graduation in May 2022with a Bachelor's of Science 
                            in Software Engineering. While I had never encounter software development of any kind before beginning my degree, my affinity for 
                            computers and technology has been a constant source of inspiration for me which I can now deploy as a software developer with the tools I 
                            have acquired over the last few years. Of my time here at ASU, certain skills in software engineering have resonated with me greater 
                            than others; if you wish to see a short summary of said skills, please see the table below. I've enjoyed nearly every topic I have studied
                            here and have no particular preference nor aversion to any particular topic; I am mostly just excited to get out into the world and see
                            where I can go.
