                                Of course, if I were to only sit on my computer all day programming, I would probably go crazy.
                                Work outside of school has me serving my 4th year with Arizona State University's Polytechnic Residence

                                programming (as in events), leadership, advocacy, and networking for those living on campus. As of right now, I am serving my

                                For fun, video games have always been a staple part of my life; starting early on with the Playstation 1 (which was my father's)
                                & the original GameBoy, with Pokemon being the first game I myself ever actually "owned". Those initial impressions stuck with me,
                                transitioning from console to console up till today where I frequently play games on my PC & nintendo switch; enjoying new installations
                                for classic single-player series such as legend of zelda or pokemon alongside fantastic multiplayer experiences with my friends such
                                as Final Fantasy XIV. One of my favorite interactions in the whole game is a Boss Fight active time manuever clipped below!

                                When I feel like getting some fresh air, I really enjoy going on walks (especially in a forest near my home in Illinois). In the past,
                                I was extremely physically active, but due to old injuries I'm no longer able to do so. However, I strongly believe in a balance between
                                my very tech centric work/pleasure habits & time away from the screens; making walks outside one of my favorite parts of my day.
