Chapter 1: Internet and Web Basics

Birth:
    - The Internet began as a network to connect computers at research facilities and universities

    - network was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
        > Consisted of for computers (UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, UoUtah) in 1969

Growth:
    - Networks were established and connected making the internet (inter connected network)

    - Was originally for edu and gov only but the commercial use ban was lifted 1991

    - Come 2017 over 4 billion came to use the itnernet, rougly half the world's population

    - While working at CERN, a research facility in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web to be able to view peer papers and research 
        - In 1991, Berners-Lee posted the code This version of the World Wide Web used HTTP and it was text based, employing Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to format the documents.
    
First Browser:
    - In 1993 Mosiac was made by a UoI student as the first graphic browser, they'd later make netscape which is an ancestor of FireFox
    - Early 90's made it all cheaper and as more people became connected the HTTP + HTML + Information coalesed into the worldwide web

Web Standards:
    -  W3C, takes a proactive role in developing recommendations and prototype technologies related to the Web
    - These recommendations are not rules; they are guidelines
    - Big part is the Americans with Disabilities Act accomodations so people with barriers to access can still utilize the web
    - Universal design is a â€œstrategy for making products, environments, operational systems, and services welcoming and usable to the most diverse range of people possible

Web Browsers and Web Servers
    - Massive section explaining what servers, clients, and netowrk are as well as protocols
    - Key terms:
        > Servers
        > Clients
        > Networking Hardware
        > Browser Request and Server Response protocols
        > HTTP(S)
        > TCP
        > IP
        > SMTP
        > FTP
        > URL Formatting (protocol, web server name, navigation, file name/queury)
        > HTML vs XML

HTML 5:
    - Ver 5 was approved late 2012 and added native video and then 5.2 was formally recommended by 2017
    - Since many types, each page has an identifier- the Document Type Definition (DTD)
        > First line for every web page, for HTML it's <!DOCTYPE html>
    - Every single web page you create will include the html, head, title, meta, and body elements 
        > We will follow the coding style to use lowercase letters and place quotes around attribute values
            
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
            <title>Page Title Goes Here</title>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            </head>
            <body>
            ~~~ body text and special tags ~~~
            </body>
            </html>

    - First few lines will be near identical and this format is super repetitive

    - Tags are bordered to their respective sections with opening <---> and closing </--->

    - lang attribute specifies the spoken language ex: lang="en" for english 

    - head section contains information that describes the web page document

    - The body section contains the actual tags, text, images, and other objects that are displayed

Head Section:
    - includes:
        > the title of the web page 
        > meta tags that describe the document (such as the character encoding used and information that may be accessed by search engines)
        > references to scripts and styles
    
    *Many of thesedo not show on the web page itself

    Head Element:
        - Section from <head> to </head>
        - Always has at LEAST two elements: the title element and meta element

            Title Element:
                > first element in the head section
                > Configures the title bar of the browser's window
                > The big one that shows in search engines, can include keywords and relevance & even show on results pages for searches
            
            Meta Element:
                > Describes a characteristic of a web page (like char encoding)
                > Character encoding is the internal representation of letters, numbers, and symbols (like UTF-8)

Body Section:
    - contains text and elements that display directly on the web page within the browser window, also referred to as the browser viewport
    - Purpose: to configure content on the web page(s)

    Body Element:
        > begins with <body> and ends with </body>
        > most of the time making a web page is in here
        > Contains text and other special elements which will be displayed in said page
